    <h1>Q & A</h1>
    <h2>Why did you create Wren? <a href="#why-did-you-create-wren" name="why-did-you-create-wren" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2>
<p>Other creative endeavors aren&rsquo;t immediately met with existential crises, but 
for some reason programmers don&rsquo;t seem to like new languages. Here&rsquo;s the niche 
I&rsquo;m trying to fill: </p>
<p>There are a few scripting languages used for embedding in applications. Lua is 
the main one. TCL used to be. There&rsquo;s also Guile, increasingly JavaScript, and 
some applications embed Python. I&rsquo;m an ex-game developer, so when I think 
&ldquo;scripting&rdquo;, I tend to think &ldquo;game scripting&rdquo;. </p>
<p>Lua is nice: it&rsquo;s small, simple, and fast. But&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t mean this as a 
criticism&mdash;it&rsquo;s also weird if you&rsquo;re used to languages like C++ and Java. 
The syntax is different. The semantics, especially the object model are 
unusual. Anyone can get used to 1-based indexing, but things like metatables 
really show that objects were bolted onto Lua after the fact. </p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s room for a language as simple as Lua, but that feels natural to 
someone with an OOP background. Wren is my attempt at that. </p>
<h2>Why classes? <a href="#why-classes" name="why-classes" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2>
<p>Thanks to JavaScript&rsquo;s popularity, lots of people are discovering prototypes 
right now, and the paradigm is experiencing a popularity boom. I think 
prototypes are interesting, but after <a href="http://finch.stuffwithstuff.com/">several years playing with them</a>, 
I concluded (like many people on the original Self project that invented 
prototypes) that classes are more usable. </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of that kind of object-oriented programming in Lua: </p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-lua">Account = {} 
Account.__index = Account

function Account.create(balance) 
   local acnt = {}             -- our new object 
   setmetatable(acnt,Account)  -- make Account handle lookup 
   acnt.balance = balance      -- initialize our object 
   return acnt 
end

function Account:withdraw(amount) 
   self.balance = self.balance - amount 
end

-- create and use an Account 
account = Account.create(1000) 
account:withdraw(100)</code></pre>


<p>Here&rsquo;s the same example in Wren: </p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-wren">class Account { 
  construct new(balance) { _balance = balance } 
  withdraw(amount) { _balance = _balance - amount } 
}

// create and use an Account
var account = Account.new(1000) 
account.withdraw(100)</code></pre>


<p>Classes have a reputation for complexity because most of the widely used 
languages with them are quite complex: C++, Java, C#, Ruby, and Python. I hope 
to show with Wren that it is those languages that are complex, and not classes 
themselves. </p>
<p>Smalltalk, the language that inspired most of those languages, is famously 
simple. Its syntax <a href="http://www.jarober.com/blog/blogView?showComments=true&amp;title=Readability+is+Key&amp;entry=3506312690">fits on an index card</a>. My aim is to keep Wren that 
minimal while still having the expressive power of <a href="classes.html">classes</a>. </p>
<h2>Why compile to bytecode? <a href="#why-compile-to-bytecode" name="why-compile-to-bytecode" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="performance.html">performance page</a> has more details, but the short answer 
is that bytecode is a nice trade-off between performance and simplicity. Also: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Many devices like iPhones and game consoles don&rsquo;t allow executing code 
    generated at runtime, which rules out just-in-time compilation. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think <a href="concurrency.html">fibers</a> are a really powerful tool, and implementing them is 
    straightforward in a bytecode VM that doesn&rsquo;t use the native stack. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why is the VM stack-based instead of register-based? <a href="#why-is-the-vm-stack-based-instead-of-register-based" name="why-is-the-vm-stack-based-instead-of-register-based" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2>
<p>Bytecode VMs come in two flavors. Stack-based VMs have short (usually one byte) 
instructions whose operands are implicitly understood to be at the top of the 
stack. That means you often have a couple of instructions to push some stuff on 
the stack and then an instruction to do something. </p>
<p>Register-based VMs have big instructions (usually 32 bits) that contain both an 
opcode and a couple of numbers indicating where in the stack the operands can 
be found. This is cool because it means, that, for example, this Lua statement: </p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-lua">a = b + c</code></pre>


<p>Can be a single bytecode instruction. In a stack-based language, it would be 
four&mdash;push <code>b</code>, push <code>c</code>, add, store <code>a</code>. (Though note that in both cases 
you&rsquo;ve got 32 total bits of code.) </p>
<p>Lua used to be stack-based and switched to register-based and got a speed 
boost. Why not use registers for Wren? </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve implemented a <a href="http://finch.stuffwithstuff.com/">register-based VM 
before</a>. I think it&rsquo;s a cool model, but I
don&rsquo;t think it would bring much benefit for Wren. It&rsquo;s more effort to compile, 
and I&rsquo;m trying to keep Wren&rsquo;s implementation as simple as possible. </p>
<p>In return for that complexity, you can generate fewer instructions. However, I 
don&rsquo;t think Wren would be able to take advantage of that. Wren doesn&rsquo;t 
currently have any dedicated instructions for arithmetic. Operators are just 
regular method calls and can call user-defined procedures. </p>
<p>The calling convention for methods requires all of their parameters to be at 
the top of the caller&rsquo;s stack so that they can become bottom of the callee&rsquo;s 
stack frame window. To call <code>+</code> in Wren, we still have to push the arguments on 
top of the stack. Likewise, the method calling convention places the return 
value where the first argument was, so we&rsquo;d have to move it back down to the 
destination slot after the call. </p>
<p>It may be worth having dedicated instructions for arithmetic that special case 
the built-in types before falling back to user-defined operator methods (which 
I assume is what Lua does since they added operator overloading late in the 
language&rsquo;s development). If that happens, it may be possible to switch to 
register-based. </p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not convinced it would be an actual performance win. A lot of details 
of the language affect whether a register-based VM is better. For example, 
assignments are statements in Lua but expressions in Wren, which would make 
them harder to compile to efficient register-based code. </p>
<h2>What about your other languages? <a href="#what-about-your-other-languages" name="what-about-your-other-languages" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2>
<p>This is a strange question if you don&rsquo;t happen to know <a href="http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com">who I am</a>. In the 
past, I&rsquo;ve hacked on and blogged about a couple of other hobby languages like 
<a href="http://finch.stuffwithstuff.com/">Finch</a> and <a href="http://magpie-lang.org/">Magpie</a>. </p>
<p>I started Finch to learn more about implementing an interpreter and also about 
the prototype paradigm. I learned a ton about both. Critically, I learned that 
I really prefer classes over prototypes. I started retrofitting classes into 
Finch but realized it was too big of a change, and thus Wren was born. </p>
<p>Wren is a replacement for Finch to me. I gave it a new name mainly so that I 
can keep Finch around in case other people want to take it and do something 
with it. I don&rsquo;t have any intention to work on it anymore. </p>
<p>Magpie is a trickier one. I really like the ideas behind Magpie. It&rsquo;s the 
general-purpose language I wish I had much of the time. I love pattern matching 
and multiple dispatch. I like how it integrates the event-based IO of <a href="https://github.com/joyent/libuv">libuv</a> 
with the simplicity of fibers. </p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also a much more challenging project. As a general-purpose language, 
there&rsquo;s a ton of library work to do before Magpie is useful for anything. It 
has some unresolved GC issues. And I&rsquo;m frankly not skilled enough right now to 
implement multiple dispatch efficiently. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, since I started working on Magpie, <a href="http://julialang.org/">Julia</a>
appeared and <a href="http://opendylan.org/">Dylan</a> <em>re</em>appeared. I created Magpie
partially to carry the torch of multiple dispatch, but others are starting to 
spread that light now. </p>
